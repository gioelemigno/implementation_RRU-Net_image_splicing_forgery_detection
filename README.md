# implementation_RRU-Net_image_splicing_forgery_detection
Project of vision and perception course

## Abstract 
The objective of the project is to develop a neural network capable of detecting a
splicing forgery image, in particular locating the specific forgery region.
The splicing forgery is a image manipulation technique that copies parts of one
image and then pastes it into another one to obtain a new image which usually
has a different meaning.
